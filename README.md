# Sleeping-Teacher-Assistant
A simulation of the Sleeping teacher assistant problem's solution.
The STA problem is a real time application of process synchronization. There are many other problems that can be solved using the
concept of Mutual exclusion and Semaphores such as Dining philosopher problem and Producer Consumer problem. If we try to implement
the solution for these problems using threads alone, we might come across the problem of multiple processes accessing the same
memory and this leads to inconsistency of the values stored in a variable. So we have to restrict access to the same variable by
more than one process. The concurrent operations can be done without inconsistency of data by using the concepts like critical
section and mutual exclusion.
